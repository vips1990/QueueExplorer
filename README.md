# QueueExplorer

The QueueExplorer application I've developed can be used to deserialize messages in queue and read them, count number of messages so you can set a custom email alerts if they grow up unexpected. You could also move messages in bulk between the queues and subqueues. Usually there are lot of fancy paid applications like QueueExplorer and many more. This is just a thing to get rid of paid applications. It's currently in development so I'd be improving it with GUI and adding configurations that provide more customizations.
